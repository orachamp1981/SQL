-----------------------------------Oracle Analytic Functions -------------------------------------------------------------
1. LEAD

Q:- Orgaization would like to know how fast or slow they are hiring and what gap occur during one to next hire?

A:- We will use analytic function "LEAD" this will sort out the row as per our requirement in ascending order hiredate.
    without any selfjoin we will get next hire date. From the set of record we will easily answer the difference of hiring
    days from last.

select ename, hiredate, nexthired, nexthired-hiredate Difference_in_Days
from
(SELECT ename, hiredate,
LEAD(hiredate, 1) OVER (ORDER BY hiredate) AS NextHired
FROM emp)
 

2. DENSE_RANK, FIRST, LAST

Q:- Organization wants to know payscale statics for each department? 

A:- We use three statical functions (DENSE_RANK, FIRST, LAST) provided by Oracle example is under:-
    
    	SELECT deptno,
	MIN(sal) KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST ORDER BY comm) "High",
	MAX(sal) KEEP (DENSE_RANK LAST ORDER BY comm) "Low"
	FROM emp
	GROUP BY deptno;

Note:- Current statics is for salary, we can use if scenario based on product sale, profit loss etc


3. Mean, Median and Mode function 

Mean, median, and mode are three kinds of average values that can be obtained from a set of data.

How to Calculate the Mean, Median, and Mode in Oracle

Mean: This is the “average” that you might know. It’s the sum of all of the numbers divided by the count of numbers.
Median: This is the middle value of a list of numbers.
Mode: This is the value that occurs most often 
Standard Deviation: A value that represents how much numbers differ from each other

Mean = Avg in Oracle

select avg(sal) from emp;

What excatly the query going to do is to take sum of the rows in column/total number of rows.

To calculate the median in Oracle SQL, we use the MEDIAN function.

The MEDIAN function returns the median of the set of provided values.

The MEDIAN is the middle value in a set of values.

So, for example, you had these five values:

10, 15, 18, 23, 40.

The median of these would be the middle value after they have been ordered in ascending order. So, the median would be 18.

20000, 10000, 800, 1600, 1250, 2975, 1250, 2850, 2450, 3000, 5000, 1500, 1100, 950, 3000, 1300

select median(sal) from emp;

In this case the answer will be 2025 because we have 16 values median first sort sal in ascending then go to mid point

800, 950, 1100, 1250, 1250, 1300, 1500, 1600, 2450, 2850, 2975, 3000, 3000, 5000, 10000, 20000

If rows are even then two middle values considered and there middle taken which is 2025 values taken (1600, 2450).

For Mode we use following query 

select stats_mode(sal) from emp order by 1;
select stats_mode(sal) from emp;

Not matter which query will be used answer remain same in that case.
We will get in one query as well

select avg(sal) Mean_Sal, median(sal) Median_Sal,  stats_mode(sal) Mode_Sal from emp order by 1;

If analysis done on the basis of department wise median salary then following query can be used to obtain data 
select distinct(deptno), median(sal) over (partition by deptno) Median_Sal_Dept from emp;
